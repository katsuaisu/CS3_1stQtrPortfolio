## topics i know well :O
1. **\[ if else statements :3 ]**   An if-else statement checks whether a specific input meets a specific requirement. I really enjoyed doing this because if-else are my favorite topic when it comes to coding. We've been doing it since grade 7 ( some may have been doing it earlier) and I think I've had enough practice to master it. It feels like those electric coin banks where you have to input something very specific to get something you want. 
2. **\[ arithmetic operators ]**   Same reasoning for number 1, we've been practicing it for a very long time now and we've had enough practices to have a grasp on how they should be used. Some of them are commonly used not only in coding which makes it easier to identify them. 
3. **\[ how to use github ( if this counts) ]**   As somebody who explored Github before and was very clueless, Sir teaching us the basics on how it works was really helpful. 
4. **\[ interpretation of loops  ]**   I'd say I'm very comfortable with knowing how to interpret/dissect loops. It's just a matter of knowing how and why a structure works (like how i++ works instead of i+). 
5. **\[ variable declaration ]**   One of the basics for coding are variables so I'd say I have this under control. I know the boundaries, types of variables, and how to use them (ex. how, in some cases, strings can be better than numerical variables).

## Topics I Need More Practice With
1. **\[ execution of loops ]** – I think I need more practice in piecing my knowledge in loops together since even if I understand how a part of a loop works, I still need a bit more exercises in do, while, and for loops. 2. **\[ the last long test part 2 ]** – That took me so long and I don't know why. I had to pull up my calculator and MS paint because I was trying to visualize the problem. 3. **\[ i can't think of anything sir sad face ]** sad face the quarter was so short :c

## Plan of Action
1. I will set aside extra study sessions every week to review my weaker topics.2. I will ask questions in class and participate more during discussions.3. I will form a study group with classmates to share understanding.4. I will use online resources (videos, tutorials, practice problems) to reinforce learning.5. I will consult my teacher for clarification when needed. 6. Neocities for the win :DD

## Class Activities Reflection
### Effective Activities
1. **\[ guess the word ]** – I liked the game alot because it helped me with my CSS skills and I got to talk to my classmates about how they designed their own game. .2. **\[ jellyfish!!! ]** – I love CSS and I love aquatic animals so the jellyfish was the best one for me because I learned on how to animate and design animals with really limited (??) resources.
### Less Effective Activities
1. **\[i loved everything !!! ]** – everything was awesome :D
